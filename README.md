# theShoppersCard-v2
TheShoppersCard + PHP and MYSQL 
This project was meant to be only a front end design of The Shopper's Card. 
As time progressed, I decided to continue developing it to include a functional backend using PHP and MySQL database.
The original project is still on github under theshopperscard repository.
